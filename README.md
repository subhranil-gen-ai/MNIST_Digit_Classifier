# MNIST_Digit_Classifier
Image classification using the MNIST dataset â€” built with Scikit-Learn, tuned with hyperparameters, and powered by pipelines. A foundational machine learning project focusing on supervised classification

ðŸ”¢ MNIST Digit Classification
This project demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It covers model training, evaluation, and sets the foundation for building machine learning pipelines and applying hyperparameter tuning.
